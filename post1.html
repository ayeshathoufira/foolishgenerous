        <p>Really interesting two part analysis of the audit conducted after the 2020 election in Windham, New Hampshire.</p>

        <p>Based on preliminary reports published by the team of experts that New Hampshire engaged to examine an election discrepancy, it appears that a buildup of dust in the read heads of optical-scan voting machines (possibly over several years of use) can cause paper-fold lines in absentee ballots to be interpreted as votes...
        New Hampshire (and other states) may need to maintain the accuracy of their optical-scan voting machines by paying attention to three issues: </p>
<br>
        <p>Routine risk-limiting audits to detect inaccuracies if/when they occur.</p>
        <p>Clean the dust out of optical-scan read heads regularly; pay attention to the calibration of the optical-scan machines.</p>
        <p>Make sure that the machines that automatically fold absentee ballots (before mailing them to voters) donâ€™t put the fold lines over vote-target ovals. (Same for election workers who fold ballots by hand.)</p>
